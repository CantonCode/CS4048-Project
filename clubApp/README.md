# UL Surf
CS4084 Mobile Application Development

This app was created to provide a central place for the UL Surf Club ( http://www.ulsurf.com/ ) gear rental system. Currently this app provides a gear rental functionality along with an in app messaging system for all surf club related items. This app can easily be expanded upon to provide a blog for all related surf club events and activities. This app also has the potential to be modified and not only cater for the surf club but also many other clubs among the university e.g. kayak club where large gear inventories also come into play.


## Getting started

* To get the app running a user might sign up wit a valid email address and fill in the other necessary form fields (such as name, student ID, password, username and profile picture).
* Once the user has signed up they will be automatically logged in and free to use the app as they wish.
* If you are running the app on an emulator from the source code in Android Studio, you must set your location in the emulator beforehand to access the 'Find Boathouse' and 'Find Pool' features. Here is a tutorial on doing so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47528006/how-to-set-the-location-manually-in-android-studio-emulator?noredirect=1&lq=1

* The project uses Firebase for it's authentication and database. If you have been granted access to the console then you can view it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/clubapp-surf/overview
